OpenPass App Design Overview
I've created several SVG wireframes and diagrams to visualize the OpenPass app based on your requirements:

App Flow Diagram - Shows the user journey and main navigation paths through the app
Login Screen - Clean, minimal design with logo and authentication options
Dashboard/Vault - Password management view with search, filtering, and password cards
Passphrase Generator - Interface for creating secure passphrases with customization options
Password Details - Detailed view of a single password with copy/edit functions
Settings Screen - Configuration options including profile, security, and appearance
Architecture Diagram - Comprehensive view of app components and their relationships
HTML Mockup - Interactive sample showing responsive design of the password vault

Key Design Elements
The wireframes follow the requirements you specified:

Clean, modern, minimalist design
Focus on security and privacy
Support for light/dark mode (toggles shown in settings)
Responsive design considerations

User Experience Flow
The app follows a logical flow:

Users authenticate via login screen
Main dashboard shows password vault with all stored items
Users can generate new passphrases with customizable options
Individual passwords can be viewed and managed in detail
Settings provide configuration options for security and appearance

Implementation Considerations
For development, you could implement this design using:

React or Flutter for cross-platform compatibility
Secure local storage with encryption
Diceware algorithm for passphrase generation
Responsive design principles for mobile and desktop
